# Kpop Chat

To say: Mobile app that connects user with virtual friends to chat about Kpop related stuffs and share common interests.
Basically: Just another useless piece of crap to push to GooglePlay and pull some ad revenue using popular Google Trends Topic. Thanks to Googly Googly

##### Used services:

- Firebase Authentication (Google Sign In)
- OpenAI for generating message reply to user's message based on the current conversation and virtual friend's profile information.
- Adobe Firefly for virtual friend's image generation.
- Cloud Firestore (For saving user profile related information)

##### Todo tasks:

- Google Admobs
- Publish to GooglePlay
  Note: The term 'virtual friend' here refers to a bot.
